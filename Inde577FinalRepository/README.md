# INDE577 -- Introduction to Machine Learning
## Rahul Prakash, Spring 2024

In this repository, we take a tour of various Machine Learning models. Each machine learning model that we explore will contain a subdirectory that contains a README file with a brief overview of the model and a Jupyter Notebook where each model is thorougly explained and then applied to a dataset. The dataset that I chose for this project is a 2023 NBA salary and player statistics dataset that includes data on over 470 players. 

We first start our exploration of Machine Learning models in Supervised Learning where we learn about models such as the Perceptron Model and Gradient Descent. We then go into Unsupervised Learning models where we look into Clustering and PCA. 

This project was really intereresting and I learned a lot about machine learning algorithms and the pros and cons of each. Below is a table of contents of this repository. Hope you enjoy the tour!
