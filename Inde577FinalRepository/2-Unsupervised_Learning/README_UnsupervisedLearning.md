# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised Learning is a type of machine learning that operates on unlabeled data, trying to identify inherent patterns without the guidance of a specific target variable. It excels in discovering the underlying structure of data through methods like clustering, where it groups similar items together, and dimensionality reduction, which simplifies large sets of data while retaining their essential characteristics. Common algorithms include K-means for clustering and PCA for dimensionality reduction. Unsupervised learning is particularly valuable in exploratory data analysis, anomaly detection, and complex systems where manual labeling of data is impractical. Despite its versatility, it challenges modelers to validate outcomes since the lack of labeled data can make performance metrics less clear-cut.
