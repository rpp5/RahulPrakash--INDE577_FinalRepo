# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used in exploratory data analysis and for dimensionality reduction of large datasets. By transforming a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set, PCA helps in simplifying the complexity in high-dimensional data while preserving trends and patterns. This is achieved by identifying the directions, called principal components, along which the variation of the data is maximized. PCA is particularly useful in processing and visualizing genetic data, as well as in finance and signal processing, where making predictions from large datasets is crucial and challenging.
