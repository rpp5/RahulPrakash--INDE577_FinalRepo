# Ensemble Methods

Ensemble Methods are advanced machine learning techniques that combine multiple models to produce a superior output compared to a single model. This approach leverages the strength of multiple learners to improve the accuracy and robustness of predictions, typically through methods like Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking. Ensemble methods are particularly effective in reducing variance (Bagging), bias (Boosting), or improving predictions (Stacking). These methods are widely used in competitions and real-world applications to achieve state-of-the-art performance by aggregating the capabilities of individual models into a more powerful composite model, thus enhancing the decision-making capabilities across various tasks.
