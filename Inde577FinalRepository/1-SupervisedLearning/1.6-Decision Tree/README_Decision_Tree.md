# Decision Tree

A Decision Tree is an intuitive and widely-used machine learning algorithm that models decisions and their possible consequences, including chance event outcomes, resource costs, and utility. It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent decision rules, and each leaf node represents the outcome. Decision Trees are used for both classification and regression tasks. The simplicity of decision making and the ease of interpretation make Decision Trees a preferred choice for exploratory data analysis, strategic planning, and visualizing complex decision processes. They are also the foundational building blocks for more complex ensemble methods such as Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines.
