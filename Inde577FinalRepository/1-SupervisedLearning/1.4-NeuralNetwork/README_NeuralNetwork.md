# Neural Networks

Neural Networks are complex architectures modeled after the human brain, designed to recognize patterns and solve a variety of tasks such as classification, regression, and clustering. These networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes or neurons, where each layer transforms input data into more abstract representations through weights adjusted by learning algorithms like backpropagation, often using gradient descent. Activation functions such as ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh introduce non-linearities essential for learning complex decision boundaries. While powerful for modeling non-linear relationships and making predictions on unseen data, neural networks can be prone to overfitting and require significant computational resources, especially as the network's depth and complexity increase. This makes them both versatile and demanding, driving advancements in fields ranging from computer vision to natural language processing.
