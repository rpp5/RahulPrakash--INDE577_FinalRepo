# The Perceptron Model

The Perceptron is a foundational single-neuron model extensively used in machine learning for binary classification tasks. This model classifies data into two distinct categories by iteratively adjusting its weights based on input features. Inspired by the functionality of biological neurons, the Perceptron is both simple and effective, serving as a vital building block for more complex neural architectures. Its straightforward mechanism involves learning from training data to reduce classification errors, thereby improving accuracy over time. In this document, we will delve into the implementation and application of the Perceptron model using the college basketball dataset (cbb), illustrating how it can effectively differentiate between various performance metrics of teams.
