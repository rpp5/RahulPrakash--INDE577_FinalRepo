# Gradient Descent

Gradient Descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm used extensively in machine learning to minimize a function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient. It is primarily used to update the parameters of a model, such as weights in neural networks, to minimize the cost function, typically the mean squared error in regression or cross-entropy loss in classification. The process involves taking controlled steps, determined by a parameter known as the learning rate, to reach the minimum value of the function efficiently. This method is pivotal in training machine learning models where analytical solutions are infeasible due to the complexity or size of the data. In practice, variations such as Stochastic Gradient Descent and Mini-batch Gradient Descent are employed to improve convergence and computational efficiency, particularly useful in large datasets.
